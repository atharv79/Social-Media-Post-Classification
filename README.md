# Social-Media-Post-Classification

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a Social Media Post Classification project using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The goal of this project is to automatically categorize social media posts into predefined classes or topics, such as politics, sports, entertainment, technology, etc.

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a large dataset of social media posts from various platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the collected data including text normalization, tokenization, removing stop words, handling emojis, URLs, and mentions, and possibly stemming or lemmatization.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data using NLP techniques like Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), or BERT embeddings.

4. **Model Selection**: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or deep learning models like RNNs, CNNs, or Transformer-based models (BERT).

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the selected models on the labeled dataset and evaluate using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search to optimize performance.

7. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model into a production environment, either as a standalone application or integrated into existing social media platforms via APIs.

8. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor the deployed model's performance and update/retrain periodically to adapt to evolving trends and changes in social media content.
